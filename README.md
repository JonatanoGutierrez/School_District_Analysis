# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to show the aggregate scores for Reading and Math for a given school district, based on characteristics of the schools. There was also an effort to remove a certain set of scores (9th graders at Thomas High School), and then analyze the subsequent changes to the data.
